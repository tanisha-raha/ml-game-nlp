Write a short piece of fantasy lore about Ebonridge Keep. The tone should be somber. Keep it vivid and coherent. Let's say that if the player is in control of their own mind, they can always read more than one chapter or two before setting out for an epic adventure with dragons!
The story was written by Dan Stevens (Witchcraft) from 1995-1996 through 2002. A few years ago we began writing this book because I just wanted to start my career as writer at 4th grade. To have time to do so would need to spend countless hours working on another level every day doing something new. My goal has been to create three books: Fantasy Storytelling Adventures - One Book First published 1996
